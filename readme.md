## MOOCs and random projects

This repository include MOOCs' codes and random codes written as extracurricular for learning practice. The MOOCs I enrolled in till now are edX and Coursera, and their codes are not meant to be complete programs but only for references and learning practice. Source for learning, the data, etc.: [www.google.com](https://www.google.com/) Excuse the silliness! :see_no_evil::hear_no_evil::speak_no_evil:
